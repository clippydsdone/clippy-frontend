[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=clippydsdone_clippy-frontend&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=clippydsdone_clippy-frontend)

This is repository contains code for frontend of project [Clippy: smart PDF reader for better paper reading experience and knowledge mining](https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2023/icse-2023-score-2023#clippy:-smart-pdf-reader-for-better-paper-reading-experience-and-knowledge-mining). 

## Tools & platforms

- Git for version control.
- [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/clippy-63600767a63c240a624ccea7/board) in addition to GitHub board for tracking work items and SCRUM organisation.
- [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/project/overview?id=clippydsdone_clippy-frontend) for code quality check.

## Libraries used

- [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/): A general-purpose, web standards-based platform for parsing and rendering PDFs.
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org): D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3â€™s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.
- [Citation.js](https://citation.js.org): Citation.js (GitHub, NPM) converts formats like BibTeX, BibJSON, DOI, and Wikidata to CSL-JSON to convert to styles like APA, Vancouver and to BibTeX and RIS.

## Branching Strategy

There are only 2 long-standing (remote) branches:

1. **dev**: Contains all the code in the current SCRUM iteration.
2. **main**: Contains the release for the previous SCRUM iteration.

There are only 2 types of temporary branches:

1. **feature/(IssueId)-(issue-name)**: Contains current work being developed for the Issue. Example of valid feature branch name for issue `Setup repo and wiki` with ID `22` would be `feature/22-setup-repo-and-wiki`
2. **bugfix/(IssueId)-(issue-name)**: Contains current work being developed for the Issue of type `Bug`. Example of valid feature branch name for issue `PDF.js not rendering` with ID `42` would be `bugfix/42-pdf-js-not-rendering`

When issues are closed temporary branches are **squashed and deleted**.

```

## Local environment
- To test application locally install [PHP server](https://windows.php.net/download#php-8.1) and put the installation files in your local environment so you can run the commands from the powershell. Then run `php -S localhost:8000` to test your code locally as it is in the Heroku enivornment.
